# SOLAR-PANEL-MONITORING-SYSTEM
Summer project-2024
This project uses an ESP32 with DHT11 sensors, LDRs, and a voltage divider circuit to monitor key parameters of a solar panel, including temperature, humidity, dust accumulation (via LDR), and voltage output. The data is transmitted wirelessly ,displayed in real-time using Blynk software and created a PCB board in Kicad software. A DC motor is integrated to provide panel vibrations for dust removal, enabling automated maintenance and performance optimization.
